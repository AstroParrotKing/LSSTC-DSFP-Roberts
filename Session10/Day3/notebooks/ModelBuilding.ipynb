You can either learn about how to do integrals like the above in Stan (see [here](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_20/stan-users-guide/integrate-1d.html); but you will need to install a newer version of Stan and do some fancy coding---this is expert-mode!) or you can use the following rational function approximation to $d_L$ that is good to $z \\simeq 1.5$ or so:\n",

    "The paper [Pearson, et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.449.3082P/abstract) tried to calibrate a large number of \"mass proxies\" for galaxy groups based on simulations.  You can, of course, take each proxy one-by-one in a linear fit similar to those we have been doing.  But, a better approach is to imagine that the true mass and proxies are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution.  Stan has facilities for modelling the mean vector and covariance matrix of this multivariate normal (see [here](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_20/functions-reference/distributions-over-unbounded-vectors.html) and [here](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_20/functions-reference/covariance-matrix-distributions.html) or [here](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_20/functions-reference/correlation-matrix-distributions.html)).  Write down a model that has (log) true mass and some number of proxies drawn from such a MVN, and then constraints the parameters of this MVN using some number of observations with uncertainty.  Fit it to the data in the datasets directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now extend your model to incorporate some number of observations of only the proxy values (i.e. do not include a term in the likelihood for log mass in this subset of observations); the model can still *predict* masses from the MVN using the proxy observations and the observed common distribution.\n",
    "\n",
